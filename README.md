# Simple Jack

## Project Description

Joker has invaded the Marvel Universe and captured heroes and villains alike. Gambit was the sole survivor. You will play as Gambit to defeat Joker in rounds of Black Jack. The game currency is known as might and you increase your might by winning hands. The basic rules will allow you to "hit", "stand", and "double down" in accordance with standard Black Jack rules. Use your winnings to free Marvel heroes and villains from the shop. Each character has attributes that can increase might, health, and provide a bonus multiplier. The more characters you unlock, the more might you earn, the faster you can unlock additional characters. Will you play as a methodical gambler to slowly unlock characters and small bonuses, or will you throw caution to the wind and bet it all at a chance to earn large pots as you set your sights on obtaining the Legendary characters from the store?

## What We Learned

- The Bulma.io CSS framework
- Creating localStorage objects to reduce API calls
- More advanced jQuery techniques to allow the creation of multiple pages from one html file
- The use of algorithms for character attribute randomization and defining the value of an Ace
- Working as a group to assign roles, establish a git workflow, merging multiple branches to one development branch, and pushing to final production
- Implementing audio to enhance the overall user experience
- That Chrome DevTools can emulate mobile screen sizes, but won't always identify a potential conflict with hardware and/or software on a particular device
- Async/Await functionality to ensure code execution occurred in the correct sequence

## Obtain API Keys

API keys may be removed at some point. To use the APIs, do the following:

Marvel API - Visit [Marvel](https://developer.marvel.com), create an account and follow the link to get an API key. To test locally, add \*.\* or localhost to the authorized domain list. You will also need to add the domain of your website if you plan to deploy a live website. You should only need to use the public API key to make this application work.

Deck of Cards API - Visit [Deck of Cards](https://deckofcardsapi.com/). Recommend installing [JSON Formatter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en), a chrome extension. Then copy/paste the endpoint labeled 'Shuffle the Cards:' into your browser address bar. Get the value from the 'deck_id' key and use that for all other fetch requests.
